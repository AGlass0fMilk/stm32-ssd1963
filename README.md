# stm32-ssd1963

7" TFT screen control via FSMC on ARM Cortex-M4 device. The screen is a TFT screen from Displaytech (INT070ATFT-TS). 
It contains an SSD1963 integrated graphic controller interfaced with the stm32discovery board via flexible memory controller (FSMC). 

I created some elementary functions to communicate with the SSD1963 and to perform some basic operations as show in the video at
my Youtube channel : https://www.youtube.com/user/dynphys.
